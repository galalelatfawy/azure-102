A guy walks into a bar one night and notices something completely bizarre. At the far end of the counter, there is a man sitting next to a tiny, beautiful grand piano. And sitting at the piano is a little man, only about one foot tall, wearing a perfect tuxedo, playing classical music with the skill of a maestro.

The guy is stunned. He buys a drink, walks over to the owner of the tiny piano, and asks, "What on earth is going on here? Where did you get that?"

The owner smiles and pulls an old, dusty oil lamp out of his pocket. "I found this in an antique shop," he says. "It’s a magic lamp. There’s a genie inside."

"You're kidding," the guy says.

"Not at all," the owner replies. "Rub it and see."

So, the guy grabs the lamp and gives it a hard rub. Suddenly, POOF! A cloud of blue smoke fills the room, and a genie appears.

"I am the Genie of the Lamp," the spirit booms. "I will grant you one wish."

The guy is so excited he panics. He blurts out, "Okay, okay! I want a million bucks!"

"It is done!" says the genie. POOF! The genie vanishes back into the lamp.

Suddenly, the bar door flies open and ducks start flying in. Mallards, teals, wood ducks—thousands of them. They are flying through the windows, coming down the chimney, covering the floor, quacking loudly. The room is absolute chaos, filled with feathers and bird droppings.

The guy is swatting away feathers, screaming at the owner, "What is wrong with your genie?! I asked for a million bucks, not a million ducks! This genie is hard of hearing!"

The owner looks at the guy, gestures sadly toward the little man on the counter playing Beethoven, and shouts over the quacking:

"No kidding! Do you really think I asked for a 12-inch pianist?"
